A 2018 Fall Quarter Project in Unity for the VGDC at UCI.
Inspired by a post on the "Good Bad Ideas" board.

## Goals/Scope
lol idk.

## Contributing
Avoid working in the master branch.

There will be a `main-features` branch to work on mechanics/features and a `main-game` branch to work on assets/design.

`main-features` will merge into `main-game` whenever a feature is finished.

`main-game` will merge into `master` whenever there's a reasonable milestone.

### Programmers

It's no big deal, but:

To pull, use `git pull --rebase` to keep the commit history clean.

To merge, use `git merge --squash` for the same reason.

`git pull`, `git push`, and `git merge` are all fine though.
